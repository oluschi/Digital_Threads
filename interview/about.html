          <h2 class="question">What was your first experience with styling and how has your sense of aesthetics evolved over time? </h2>
          <div class="answer">
            <p> When I was younger, I would cut up pictures of outfits from magazines, create outfits out of them, and save them in my binder. Over the years, I realized that I leaned towards creating specific vibes; I look forward to what I am going to wear; when going to events, I look forward to creating an outfit; and I still do that today.  </p>
          </div>
          
          <h2 class="question">What type of people are you following for style inspo?</h2>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>    I tend to go for people and dress already in the vibe that I want to emulate and also people who kind of have this staples that I have in my closet,  also I follow people who are experimental, but not too far from my style

          <h2 class="question">How do you use social media to express your sense of style?</h2>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>  It's just a platform where I get to be like, "Ok, this is where I am at right now," because my style reflects my emotions or just the phase of my life in that moment." And that social media is "...also just a good way to see how my style has evolved in each era of my life.

          <h2 class="question">How has social media impact the way you dress yourself and express confidences? Describe that felt experience. ?</h2>
          <div class="answer">
            <p> It's impacted the way I dress myself more than my confidence in styling. To an extent, it is really helpful, but in a way, it gets in the way of how I turly want to express myself. <br></br>
              Always! Whenever I am wearing a good outfit, I know it is a good outfit because I am not worried about any part of it making me feel bad. In fact, I know it's a good outfit when I am not afraid to take up space in a room, and that immediately allows me to embody confidences. <br>
