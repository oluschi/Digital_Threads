      <div id="description"><p><i>by Oluschi Harmon (2023)<br><br></i>“Digital Threads” delves into the realm of self-expression and storytelling through fashion styling, particularly in the context of the rise of social media. The pervasive influence of social media and digital technology has played a significant impact on the way individuals choose to express themselves through fashion. As a product of this era, growing up as an impressionable young girl during the late 2000s, I have witnessed firsthand the transformation of fashion documentation as a common occurrence, and how it continues to shape our sartorial choices and self-presentation today.<br>

          <p>Fashion styling can be defined as an act of expression. For centuries, fashion has acted as a tangible extension of one's inner self, serving as an instrument for self-expression and “...framework for understanding how we express ourselves through dress in everyday life.”.<sup>1</sup> With the emergence of social media and the digital aesthetic in recent years, there has been a fundamental change in the expression of fashion styling, creating new opportunities for originality, self-discovery, and self-promotion<sup>2</sup> It has evolved into a platform where individuals can communicate their " relation to society, and how people present themselves to others."<sup>3</sup> As a result, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, and various other social media platforms have begun to affect this everyday practice. In order to understand the prevalent impact that social media and digital technology have had on contemporary fashion styling, one must examine how these platforms have shaped the way we choose to present ourselves to the worldthrough these digital threads. Digital Threads is a visual essay website that tackles questions about the social and cultural impact that social media has had on contemporary fashion styling.

          <h3>“HISTORY OF STYLING”</h3>
          <p>Fashion styling has frequently been used throughout history and throughout cultures to reinforce existing hierarchies by signaling one's social rank and wealth. As noted by historian Susan Brown, in <i>Fashion: The Definitive History of Costume and Style,</i> "...leisured and merchant classes could imitate noble fashions. Such mimicry of their betters prompted litigation: laws were introduced to control what people at different social levels could wear.” <sup>4</sup> While the dynamic between the industry and the consumer has always been based on hierarchy, by the late 2000s and early 2010s, the introduction of social media would drastically transform the fashion industry. Not only did social media provide an outlet for people to express their individuality, but it “… made an elitist industry more accessible and relatable to everyday consumers."<sup>5</sup>

          <h3> The Influencer and The Influence</h3>

          <p> Over the past decade, social media has changed the trajectory of the fashion landscape through the rise of ​​influencer culture. Social media influencers have been defined as a “…type of independent third-party endorser who shapes audience attitudes through blogs, tweets, and the use of other social media." <sup>6</sup> When asked how she uses social media to express her own style,<i> TikTok influencer Fatima Hassan J H Al-Jaber</i> said, "It's just a platform where I get to be like, "Ok, this is where I am at right now," because my style reflects my emotions or just the phase of my life in that moment." And that social media is "...also just a good way to see how my style has evolved in each era of my life," she added <sup>7</sup> The growth of influencer culture and social media has led to the emergence of new forms of self-expression and creative inquiry within fashion.</p><br>

          

          <p>Influencer culture has been recognized as having an impact on fashion by notable personalities, with Anna Wintour welcoming the shift brought about by social media and attributing it to expanding Vogue's reach.<sup>8</sup> Through a survey conducted and posted, on how others utilize social media to express their sense of style, it was found that many people use these platforms as a way of capturing their journey through fashion and visual storytelling <sup> 9 </sup>    As a result of the documentation of their own takes on fashion trends and styling, influencers and their followers have developed a relationship that has elevated them to celebrity status. Despite the fact that social media is frequently used as a means of self-expression, it's critical to acknowledge the damages it has caused in regards to individuals and the environment.</p>

          <h3>"Impact of Social Media"</h3>

          <p>Throughout social media, discussions on the loss of individuality and personal style have been credited to the overconsumption of media. In an interview, stylist Avena Gallagher spoke about the unfortunate impact social media has had on the acceleration of trends.<sup>10</sup> Due to the consistent push for what is new and trendy, the fast fashion model of the industry has raised "concerns about clothing companies taking responsibility for their impact on the environment, workforce, and suppliers.” <sup> 11</sup>  The decisions made by companies to push influencers to promote fast fashion have led to the treatment of  consumers “...the lowest-priced garments as nearly disposable, discarding them after just seven or eight wears.<sup>12</sup>  As the fashion industry and consumers continue to grapple with these concerns, it is essential to recognize the role that social media has played in shaping individual styles and the industry as a whole.


          
          <p>Fashion styling is an expressive act that has evolved over time with the prevalence of social media and digital technology in our society. In the ever-going understanding of personal style, one should be able to “Developing your own style is taking inspiration from others while still expressing yourself and wearing what makes you feel good.”<sup>13</sup> As fashion continues to evolve, it remains a framework for understanding how we express ourselves through dress in everyday life, providing ways in which “people use dress to navigate through, or around, different social, cultural, and geographical boundaries."<sup>14</sup>Through these digital threads, individuals can gain a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted effects that social media has had on the process of cultivating personal style.</p>

          <p>There’s an offshoot of the “death by sex” trope that sees men being killed after sex by a female character, usually following an assault. We see yet again the fears of audiences being represented in horror. For men, this storyline actualizes the fear that such actions result in consequences and/or that they are complacent in the wrongdoing of their peers. Another recurring theme of this type of storyline is castration, which we can read as emasculation (aka the ultimate enemy of toxic masculinity). For female audiences, this type of storyline recognizes a fear of assault, but also gives them a sense of catharsis in seeing assailants “get what’s coming to them.” The “rape and revenge” trope gained popularity in the 1970s with films like <i>The Last House on the Left</i> (1972) and <i>I Spit on Your Grave</i> (1978). This corresponds with second-wave feminism, which represents a break away from traditional family dynamics of the 1950s and corresponds with the Civil Rights Movement.<br><br>

          2007’s <i>Teeth</i> (dir. Mitchell Lichtenstein) exemplifies both themes of castration and rape resulting in revenge. The movie is an adaptation of the Vagina Dentata, a folk story about a vagina lined with teeth that threaten male mutilation upon intercourse. The myth has traditionally been told to discourage rape. In Teeth, passionate abstinence advocate Dawn has vagina dentata. After discovering the consequences of this after a sexual assault, she begins employing her abnormality both unintentionally as a defense mechanism and intentionally as a means for revenge against predators.</p><br><br>

            11. "Empowered: Popular Feminism and Popular Misogyny" by Sarah Banet-Weiser

        <div class="text">
          <img src="section5.png" width=97%>

          <p>I find the “death by sex” trope so exciting to study because there’s a lot of range to it. It feels obvious to state that women being killed off for having sex in horror movies is inherently misogynistic. However, it’s also really interesting to see sex in horror movies being reclaimed in empowering depictions for victims of assault or being used to expose societal attitudes about STDs.<br><br>

          There’s an interesting dichotomy in the two existing at the same time, especially in the 1970s. This calls to mind Sarah Banet-Weiser’s 2019 theory of Popular Feminism and Popular Misogyny. Banet-Weiser observes that when popular media attempts to challenge gender norms and present feminist ideas (although usually commercialized and put forward to make a profit), there will always be backlash in the form of misogynistic media.<sup>11</sup> We have to remember that all producers of popular media (including horror movies) are motivated by profit and the maintenance of their power. When filmmakers attempt to move the needle in media away from misogyny, there will always be someone in power who benefits from it and has the means to create more media supporting it.<sup>11</sup><br><br>

          So where do we go from here? While I don’t expect the horror filmmakers to abandon this trope altogether, I think the best way to move forward with it is to incorporate it into richer characters. In the past 20 years since <i>Scream</i>, its become more and more common for female characters who have sex on-screen to not only survive, but be the movie’s heroes themselves. Either way, we can always count on horror movies to represent society’s dominant views on female sexuality.</p><br>
